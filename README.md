# Hangman-Project

Hangman is a guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters.

To start, the player is given a word where all letters are replaced with underscores (_) so the only information available is the number of letters in the answer.

Each round the player guesses a letter and if the letter guesed is in the answer, its position (or positions) in the word is revealed. Once they successfully fill in the hidden word with its correct letters, the player wins!

If the letter guessed is not in the answer, the player accumulates mistakes. If they make it to six mistakes without finding the answer, the player loses!
